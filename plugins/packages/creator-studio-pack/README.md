# Creator Studio Pack - Builder × Filmmaker Plugin Suite

**The Most Dangerous Skillset: Builder + Filmmaker in One Person**

Transform Claude Code into your complete creative studio - from product ideation to viral video distribution.

## 🎯 The Vision

The most powerful creators in 2025 combine:
- **Building** (design, engineering, products)
- **Filmmaking** (video, storytelling, distribution)

This pack makes that combination effortless.

## 💡 The Transformation

```
BEFORE: "I built something cool but don't know how to show it"
AFTER: "I ship products AND viral videos explaining them"

BEFORE: "Video editing takes longer than building"
AFTER: "My code writes my video scripts and edits footage automatically"

BEFORE: "I'm either building OR creating content"
AFTER: "My builds generate content automatically as I work"
```
