## Solo Builder Workflow

**The daily workflow for builders who document as they work**

### Phase 1: Build (Ongoing)

**Time**: Your normal development time
**Tools**: `build-logger-agent`, git
**Output**: Automatic build documentation

**Actions:**
```bash
# Start of project
Talk to build-logger-agent: "Start tracking my [project-name] development"

# As you work (automatic)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication"
git push

# Build logger automatically:
# ✓ Captures git commits
# ✓ Analyzes code changes
# ✓ Identifies "hero moments" (10x improvements, breakthroughs)
# ✓ Suggests video ideas
# ✓ Tracks technical debt and learnings
```

**Build Logger Output Example:**
```markdown
BUILD LOG - Day 3 - User Auth System

Commits today: 7
Lines added: 342
Lines removed: 89

HERO MOMENT 🎬:
"Implemented JWT authentication with refresh tokens"
Why it matters: Secure, scalable auth in 2 hours
Video potential: HIGH (8/10)
Title suggestion: "Building Secure Authentication in 2 Hours"

Technical decisions:
- Chose JWT over sessions (why: stateless, scalable)
- Used httpOnly cookies (security best practice)
- Implemented token rotation (compliance)

Next steps:
- Add 2FA support
- Implement rate limiting
- Add logging/monitoring
```

---

### Phase 2: Document (5 minutes)

**Time**: 5 minutes after a breakthrough
**Tools**: `build-logger-agent`, `code-explainer-video`
**Output**: Video script outline

**Actions:**
```bash
# Review build log
Talk to build-logger-agent: "What video ideas do I have from today?"

# Generate script outline
Talk to code-explainer-video: "Create a video outline for my JWT authentication implementation"
```

**Script Outline Output:**
```markdown
VIDEO OUTLINE: "Building Secure Authentication in 2 Hours"

TARGET AUDIENCE: Web developers, indie hackers
LENGTH: 8-12 minutes
STYLE: Tutorial + time-lapse

HOOK (0:00-0:15):
"Watch me build production-ready authentication in 2 hours"

STORY ARC:
1. Problem: Most apps get auth wrong
2. Solution: JWT + refresh tokens + httpOnly cookies
3. Implementation: Code walkthrough
4. Result: Secure, scalable auth system

KEY MOMENTS:
- Token generation logic
- Refresh token rotation
- Security considerations
- Testing with Postman

CALL TO ACTION:
"Download the code, star the repo, try it yourself"
```

---

### Phase 3: Record (30 minutes)

**Time**: 30 minutes focused recording
**Tools**: `screen-recorder-command`, `script-to-teleprompter`
**Output**: Raw video footage

**Actions:**
```bash
# Start recording
/record start jwt-auth-tutorial --webcam

# Optional: Load script in teleprompter
/teleprompter ~/Videos/jwt-auth-tutorial/script.md

# Record segments:
# 0:00-0:30 - Hook (show the working result first)
/record mark "Working demo - secure authentication"

# 0:30-2:00 - Problem setup
/record mark "Why most auth is insecure"

# 2:00-8:00 - Implementation walkthrough
/record mark "JWT token generation"

# 8:00-10:00 - Testing and results
/record mark "Postman tests passing"

# 10:00-10:30 - Call to action
/record mark "Try this yourself"

# Stop recording
/record stop
```

**Recording Output:**
```
