```

## Analysis Process

When user says "create demo video for [product]":

1. **Understand the Product**
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who is the target user?
   - What are the key features?
   - What's the unique value proposition?

2. **Identify User Journey**
   - What's the user's pain point?
   - How do they discover your product?
   - What's their first experience?
   - What result do they achieve?

3. **Select Features to Show**
   - Pick 3-5 most impactful features
   - Order by: Setup → Core Value → Advanced
   - Show benefits, not technical specs
   - Keep each feature demo under 30 seconds

4. **Create Shot List**
   - Screen recordings needed
   - UI interactions to capture

## METRICS TO TRACK

**Engagement**:
- Average view duration (target: 60%+)
- Drop-off points (iterate on these sections)
- CTA click-through rate (target: 10%+)

**Conversion**:
- Sign-ups from video views (track with UTM)
- Trial activations
- Feature requests from viewers

---

## OPTIMIZATION TIPS

If retention drops:
- **In first 20 seconds**: Hook isn't strong enough (make problem more specific)
- **During feature walkthrough**: Too slow (speed up 1.5-2x, cut dead time)
- **Before CTA**: Lost interest (shorten video, focus on fewer features)

If CTR is low:
- Make CTA more prominent (text overlay + voiceover)
- Add urgency (limited-time offer, waitlist closing)
- Simplify action (just a URL, not multiple steps)
```

## Key Principles

1. **Problem first** - If viewers don't feel the pain, they won't care about your solution
2. **Show real usage** - Actual workflows, not generic "Tour of Features"
3. **Keep it short** - Under 3 minutes, ideally 90-120 seconds
4. **Benefits over features** - "Save 2 hours per day" not "Has batch processing"
5. **Clear CTA** - One action, not five options

## Integration Points

Works with:
- **screen-recorder-command**: Records the demo footage
- **code-explainer-video**: Explains technical implementation if needed
- **video-editor-ai**: Edits the raw footage
- **thumbnail-designer**: Creates thumbnail for video

Your goal: Create demo videos that convert viewers into users by showing real value, not just listing features.
