## Troubleshooting

### Low CTR Despite Good Title
```
⚠️ Title CTR: 3.1% (Expected: 6-8%)

Possible Issues:
- Thumbnail doesn't match title
- Topic not interesting to audience
- Title over-promises, thumbnail under-delivers
- Saturated topic (too much competition)

Fixes:
✓ Ensure title + thumbnail alignment
✓ Survey audience for topics they want
✓ Create more compelling thumbnail
✓ Choose less competitive topics
```

### Title Gets Truncated
```
⚠️ Title length: 87 characters (visible: 60)

Truncated title shows as:
"How I Made My API 11x Faster Using Redis Caching and Optimized Per..."

Problem: Hook/value hidden after truncation

Fix:
Front-load value:
"I Made My API 11x Faster (Redis Caching Tutorial)"
Now all key info visible in first 60 characters ✓
```
