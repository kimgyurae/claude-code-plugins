📧 COLLABORATION PITCH

To: CodeWithSarah
Subject: Collaboration Idea: Frontend Meets Backend

Hey Sarah!

I'm [Your Name], I run a YouTube channel focused on backend
development and API optimization. I've been watching your
frontend tutorials and love your teaching style!

I had an idea for a collaboration that I think both our
audiences would love:

"Frontend Meets Backend: Building a Full-Stack App"

The concept:
- You build a React frontend
- I build a Node.js backend API
- We show how they work together
- Real-world project (e.g., task manager, blog)

Format options:
1. Two separate videos (one on each channel) that reference
   each other
2. One longer livestream where we build it together
3. Series: 3 videos alternating between our channels

My channel: [Your Channel] (15K subscribers)
Recent collab: [Previous successful collab, if any]

I think this would be valuable because:
✓ Your audience learns backend concepts
✓ My audience learns frontend integration
✓ Both see a complete full-stack workflow
✓ Fresh content for both of us

Would you be interested in chatting about this? I'm flexible
on format and timing.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Your recent video on React hooks was incredibly clear.
I'm stealing your explanation style! 😄

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Why This Works:
✓ Personalized (references their content)
✓ Clear value proposition
✓ Specific collaboration idea
✓ Multiple format options (flexible)
✓ Mutual benefit explained
✓ Not demanding (asks to chat)
✓ Friendly, authentic tone
