**Energy Optimization Strategies**
```
⚡ ENERGY MANAGEMENT

Morning (9am-12pm): BEST
├─ Schedule: Highest energy videos first
├─ Content: Complex topics, long videos

Early Afternoon (12pm-2pm): DIP
├─ Schedule: Break or easy content
├─ Content: Short videos, simple topics
├─ Energy level: 5-7/10
└─ Strategy: Light lunch, avoid recording if possible

Mid Afternoon (2pm-4pm): RECOVER
├─ Schedule: Medium difficulty content
├─ Content: Tutorials, standard videos
├─ Energy level: 6-8/10
└─ Strategy: Caffeine, standing desk

Late Afternoon (4pm-6pm): VARIES
├─ Schedule: Easy, fun content
├─ Content: Quick tips, casual videos
├─ Energy level: 6-9/10
└─ Strategy: Energy dependent

Evening (6pm+): AVOID
├─ Recording quality suffers
├─ More retakes needed
├─ Mental fatigue shows
└─ Exception: Specific evening audience testing

Energy Boosters:
✓ Water (16oz every hour)
✓ Light snacks (fruit, nuts)
✓ Standing breaks every 45 min
✓ 5-minute walks between groups
✓ Natural light exposure

Energy Killers:
❌ Heavy meals (food coma)
❌ Sugar crashes (avoid candy, soda)
❌ Caffeine overload (jittery on camera)
❌ Sitting too long (reduces energy)
❌ Multitasking during breaks (no rest)
```

## Batch Recording Tips

### Group by Setup
```
✓ Same location (minimize setup changes)
✓ Same lighting (consistent look)
✓ Same clothing (or smart wardrobe changes)
✓ Similar topics (maintain mental context)
✓ Similar energy level (high, medium, or low)
```

### Script Preparation
```
✓ Write all scripts 2 days before
✓ Practice each script 2-3 times
✓ Load all into teleprompter
✓ Print backup copies
✓ Highlight difficult sections
```

### Quality Assurance
```
✓ Record 5-second test before each video
✓ Watch test clip (check framing, audio, lighting)
✓ Do 2-3 takes if first isn't perfect
✓ Review recording before moving to next
✓ Don't settle for "good enough"
```
