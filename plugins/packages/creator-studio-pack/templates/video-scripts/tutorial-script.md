## Recording Tips

1. **Preparation**:
   - Test everything before recording
   - Have code ready in stages (don't debug on camera)
   - Clean up desktop/browser tabs
   - Close notifications

2. **While Recording**:
   - Speak clearly and at medium pace
   - Pause between sections (easier to edit)
   - Use markers (`/record mark "description"`)
   - If you make a mistake, pause, then restart sentence

3. **Voice Energy**:
   - Start with high energy (hook)
   - Maintain enthusiasm throughout
   - Emphasize key points
   - Celebrate when things work!

4. **Camera Position** (if using webcam):
   - Eye level with camera
   - Good lighting (face well-lit)
   - Clean background
   - Picture-in-picture in bottom right

## Editing Checklist

- [ ] Remove long silences (over 2 seconds)
- [ ] Remove filler words (um, uh, like)
- [ ] Fast-forward through boilerplate/waiting
- [ ] Add code annotations on key lines
- [ ] Add chapter markers in description
- [ ] Add on-screen text for key concepts
- [ ] Include before/after comparisons
- [ ] Add intro/outro animations
- [ ] Add background music (low volume)
- [ ] Add subtitles
- [ ] Color grade for consistent look
- [ ] Add end screen with elements

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Going too fast** - Remember viewers are following along
2. **Skipping explanation** - Explain WHY, not just HOW
3. **Too much detail** - Focus on key concepts, link to docs for details
4. **Not showing results** - Always demonstrate working feature
5. **Missing prerequisites** - State what viewers need upfront
6. **Ignoring errors** - If you hit an error, show how to fix it
7. **Weak hook** - First 15 seconds determine if viewer stays

---

## Success Metrics

**Good tutorial indicators**:
- 50%+ average view duration
- High like ratio (>5%)
- Many "thank you" comments
- Questions asking for more depth
- Saves/bookmarks
- GitHub repo stars

**Red flags**:

- Confusion about prerequisites
- Many dislikes (unclear or wrong information)

---

## Variations

- Faster pace
- Less explanation
- For viewers who want to implement quickly

### Deep Dive Tutorial (20-30 minutes)
- Slower pace
