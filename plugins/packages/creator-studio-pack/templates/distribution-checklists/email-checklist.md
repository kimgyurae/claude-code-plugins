ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip: Redis vs Memcached

Choosing between Redis and Memcached?

Redis if you need:
â€¢ Data structures (lists, sets, sorted sets)
â€¢ Persistence (save to disk)
â€¢ Pub/sub messaging

Memcached if you need:
â€¢ Pure caching (simpler)
â€¢ Multi-threading (Redis is single-threaded)

My rule: Redis for 90% of use cases.
