**Meet Alex**, a junior developer at a startup. Their team needs CI/CD, but Alex has never set one up before.

**Manual approach challenges:**
- Overwhelming documentation (GitHub Actions has 500+ pages)
- Unclear what to test (unit? integration? e2e?)
- No idea what a "good" pipeline looks like
- Fear of breaking production with bad config
- **Time required:** 2-3 days of research and trial-and-error

### The Solution with DevOps Pack

Alex uses `/github-actions-create` to generate a complete pipeline:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
/github-actions-create
```

**What happens:**
```
 Analyzing project structure...
 Detected: Node.js project with package.json
 Found: Jest tests in /tests directory
 Detected: Vercel deployment config

Recommended pipeline:
─────────────────────────────────
- Lint with ESLint
- Run Jest tests

## Use Case 7: Enterprise Standardizes Git Workflow

### The Problem

**Meet TechCorp**, a 200-developer enterprise. Every team uses different commit message formats and PR templates.

**Manual approach challenges:**
- Inconsistent commit history (impossible to search)
- PRs missing critical information
- Code review delays (reviewers need more context)
- Onboarding takes longer (every team is different)

### The Solution with DevOps Pack

TechCorp standardizes on the DevOps Pack's Git commands:

**Standard workflow for all 200 developers:**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
/branch-create
# Always creates: feature/description or bugfix/description

# 2. Make commits
/commit-smart
# Always generates: type(scope): description format

# 3. Open pull requests
/pr-create
# Always includes: Summary, Changes, Testing, Type sections
```

**Enforcement through pre-commit hooks:**

```bash
# Add to .git/hooks/commit-msg
#!/bin/bash
# Verify commit follows conventional commits
if ! grep -qE "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .+" "$1"; then
  echo " Commit message must follow conventional commits format"
  echo "Example: feat(auth): add password reset"
  exit 1
fi
```

### The Result

**Before:**
-  20+ different commit message styles
-  PRs missing context (reviewers ask questions)
