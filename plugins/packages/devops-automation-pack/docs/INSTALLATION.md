## First Test

Let's run your first command to see the pack in action.

### Create a Smart Git Commit

If you're in a Git repository with changes:

```bash
/commit-smart
```

The command will:
1. Analyze your Git changes
2. Review recent commit messages for style
3. Generate a conventional commit message
4. Show you the commit before creating it

**Example output:**
```
 Analyzing changes...
 Found 3 modified files
 Reviewed commit history

Suggested commit:
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

- Implement password reset email flow
- Add reset token validation
- Update user model with reset fields

Create this commit? (y/n):
```

Type `y` and press Enter. Your commit is created!

>  **Tip:** You can use the shortcut `/gc` instead of typing the full command name.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Command not found"

**Symptoms:**
- Running `/commit-smart` shows "unknown command"
- Plugins don't appear in `/help`

**Solution:**
1. Restart Claude Code completely
2. Reopen Claude Code
3. Run `/help` again to verify commands appear

If still not working:
```bash
claude plugin install ~/Downloads/DevOps_Automation_Pack
```

---

### Error: "Permission denied"

**Symptoms:**
- Installation fails with permission error
- Cannot execute installation script

**Solution:**

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**On Windows:**
1. Right-click PowerShell
2. Select "Run as Administrator"
3. Run installation command again

---

### Error: "Plugin already installed"

**Symptoms:**
- Installation says pack already exists
- Want to reinstall or upgrade

**Solution:**

Uninstall the old version first:
```bash
claude plugin uninstall devops-automation-pack
claude plugin install ~/Downloads/DevOps_Automation_Pack
```

This removes the old version and installs the new one.

---

### Commands work but give errors

**Symptoms:**
- Commands run but produce unexpected errors
- Features don't work as described

**Possible causes and solutions:**

**1. Git not configured:**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "[email protected]"
```

**2. Not in a Git repository:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git init  # if needed
```

**3. Missing dependencies:**

Some commands require:
- Git (for Git workflow commands)
- Docker (for Docker commands)
- kubectl (for Kubernetes commands)
- terraform (for Terraform commands)

Install only what you need for the commands you'll use.
