<!-- DESIGN DECISIONS -->
<!-- This command serves as the first interaction many users have with Claude Code.
     It must demonstrate professional quality while remaining warm and approachable.
     The greeting adapts based on context to provide immediate value. -->

<!-- ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED -->
<!-- Simple static greeting: Rejected as it provides no contextual value
     Overly complex analysis: Rejected as it would slow down a simple greeting
     No examples: Rejected as this is an example plugin that teaches patterns -->

<!-- KNOWN LIMITATIONS -->
<!-- Cannot detect user's specific project goals without additional context
     Time zone detection is based on system time, not user preference
     Project type detection is heuristic-based and may not be 100% accurate -->

# Hello Command

Provides a warm, professional greeting that acknowledges the user's current context and offers relevant assistance. This command demonstrates best practices for contextual awareness and helpful responses while serving as an exemplary template for other commands.

## When to Use

Use this command when:
- Starting a new development session to get oriented
- Wanting a quick overview of available capabilities
- Testing if Claude Code is responsive and working correctly
- Needing suggestions for what to work on in the current context
- Beginning work in an unfamiliar project or directory
- After a long break to re-engage with your project

Do NOT use this command for:
- Getting specific technical help (use specialized commands instead)
- Project analysis (use `/analyze` or audit commands)
- Generating code (use generation commands for your framework)

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Claude Code is properly installed and configured
- [ ] You are in the directory where you want to work
- [ ] No specific prerequisites - this command works anywhere

## Process

### Step 1: Analyze Current Context
The command examines your current environment to provide relevant suggestions:
- Identifies the current working directory path
- Detects project type by checking for configuration files (package.json, pom.xml, etc.)
- Notes the time of day for appropriate greeting tone
- Checks for recently modified files to understand current work
- Identifies available tools and frameworks

### Step 2: Construct Personalized Greeting
Based on the context analysis, creates a greeting that includes:
- Time-appropriate salutation (Good morning/afternoon/evening)
- Acknowledgment of the current project type if detected
- Recognition of the working directory location
- A warm but professional tone that encourages engagement

### Step 3: Offer Contextual Assistance
Provides 3-5 relevant suggestions based on what was detected:
- For identified project types: Framework-specific actions
- For unknown contexts: General development capabilities
- For error states: Troubleshooting and recovery options
- Always ends with an open question to encourage user engagement

## Output Format

The command will produce output in this format:

```
[Time-based greeting]! I'm Claude Code, ready to help with your [project type/development] work.

I notice you're [context observation]. I can help you with:
‚Ä¢ [Relevant capability 1 - specific to context]
‚Ä¢ [Relevant capability 2 - specific to context]
‚Ä¢ [Relevant capability 3 - specific to context]
[Optional: ‚Ä¢ Additional capabilities if relevant]

[Optional: Contextual tip or observation]

What would you like to work on today?
```

**Output Fields Explained:**
- `[Time-based greeting]`: "Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening" based on system time
- `[project type/development]`: Specific framework/language detected or generic "development"
- `[context observation]`: What Claude Code notices about the current directory/project
- `[Relevant capabilities]`: 3-5 specific actions that make sense in this context
- `[Contextual tip]`: Optional helpful tip specific to the detected environment

## Examples

### Example 1: React Project Context

- Recent changes: Components modified in last hour

**Command Execution:**
```bash
# Step 1: Context detection
pwd # Returns: /home/user/projects/my-react-app
ls -la # Finds: package.json, src/, public/
cat package.json | grep react # Confirms React project
find . -type f -mmin -60 # Finds recently modified components

# Step 2: Greeting construction based on findings
# Step 3: Capability matching to React context
```

**Output:**
```

**User Input:**
```
/h
```

**Context:**
- Working directory: `/home/user/data-analysis`
- Files present: Multiple .ipynb files, requirements.txt, data/ folder
- Virtual environment detected

**Command Execution:**
```bash
# Context detection finds Jupyter notebooks and data files
ls *.ipynb # Finds notebook files
test -d data && echo "Data folder found"
test -f requirements.txt && echo "Python project detected"
```

**Output:**
```
Good afternoon! I'm Claude Code, ready to help with your data science work.

## Error Handling

### Error: Permission Denied in Current Directory
**Symptoms:** Cannot read directory contents
**Cause:** Insufficient permissions
**Solution:**
```
Good morning! I'm Claude Code, though I notice I can't fully analyze this directory due to permissions.

I can still help you with:
‚Ä¢ General coding questions and solutions
‚Ä¢ Creating new files you have permission to write
‚Ä¢ Planning project architecture
‚Ä¢ Debugging code you share with me

Would you like to move to a different directory or continue here?
```
**Prevention:** Run Claude Code with appropriate permissions or work in user-owned directories

### Error: Extremely Large Project (10,000+ files)
**Symptoms:** Context analysis takes too long
**Cause:** Project too large for quick analysis
**Solution:**
```
Hello! I'm Claude Code. This appears to be a large project that would take time to fully analyze.

I can help you with:
‚Ä¢ Focused work on specific components
‚Ä¢ Architecture-level discussions
‚Ä¢ Code review for specific files
‚Ä¢ Performance optimization strategies

What specific part of this project would you like to focus on today?
```

### Error: System Time Unavailable
**Symptoms:** Cannot determine time of day
**Cause:** System clock issue or permission restriction
**Solution:** Default to neutral "Hello" greeting and continue normally

## Configuration Options

The hello command behavior can be influenced by:

### Environment Variable: `CLAUDE_CODE_GREETING_STYLE`
- **Purpose:** Adjusts greeting formality
- **Values:** `formal`, `friendly` (default), `brief`
- **Example:** `export CLAUDE_CODE_GREETING_STYLE=brief`

### Project-level `.claude/config.json`
- **Purpose:** Customize greeting for specific project
- **Example:**
```json
{
  "greeting": {
    "projectType": "Custom Framework",
    "suggestions": ["Run tests", "Check CI/CD", "Review PRs"]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Run `/hello` when starting a session for contextual orientation
- Use the shortcut `/h` for quick access
- Pay attention to the suggestions as they're context-aware
- Use this as a conversation starter for your development session

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Expect technical problem-solving from this command
- Run repeatedly in the same session (context doesn't change much)
- Ignore the contextual suggestions - they're tailored to your situation

üí° **TIPS:**
- The greeting adapts to your project - try it in different directories
- Use this command to test if Claude Code is working properly
- The suggestions can help you discover commands you didn't know about

## Related Commands

- `/analyze` - Deep analysis of your project structure and health
- `/help` - Comprehensive help and command listing
- `/status` - Check Claude Code configuration and capabilities
- `/suggest` - Get specific suggestions for your current task

## Performance Considerations

- **Typical execution time:** <1 second
- **Resource usage:** Minimal - only reads directory structure
- **Scaling notes:** May be slightly slower in very large projects
- **Optimization tips:** Use in project root for best context detection

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Considerations:**
- No sensitive information is collected or transmitted
- Directory analysis is read-only
- No files are modified or created
- Project detection uses only filename patterns, not file contents

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Greeting doesn't recognize my project type
**Solution:** Ensure project configuration files are in the root directory (package.json, pom.xml, etc.)

### Issue: Suggestions aren't relevant
**Solution:** Check you're in the correct directory and project files are standard

### Issue: Command not found
**Solution:** Verify the hello-world plugin is installed with `/plugin list`
